Weather Observations:
1.) Based on the Latitude data, as the latitude increases the temperature becomes colder. As the latitude increases the humidity becomes stronger. There seems to be no exact correlation with latitude and wind speed & cloudiness since the data is disrupted evenly in the wind speed/cloudiness section.

2.) Looking at the Northern Hemisphere data, the temperature increases as the latitude is close to 0. The humidity is common at latitudes 30-60. Cloudiness is not affected by latitude. The wind speed is more concentrated at latitudes 30-60.

3.) According to the Southern Hemisphere adta, the temperature rises as the latitude decreases. There is no correlation with latitude & humidity since the data is spraed across the graph. Cloudiness and Windspeed dose not seem to be affected by latitude because there no defining correlation.
